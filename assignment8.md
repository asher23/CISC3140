ASSIGNMENT 8 IS THE TRAVIS FILE IN THIS REPOSITORY. 
I'M USING ASSIGNMENT 3 TO DEPLOY IT.

THE URL FOR THE DEPLOYED WEBSITE IS CISC3140.HEROKUAPP.COM

THE TRAVIS FILE SIMPLY RUNS A TEST (It runs npm test) BEFORE MAKING PULL REQUESTS FROM ANOTHER BRANCH TO THE MASTER BRANCH.
CURRENTLY, I SET THE TEST TO JUST LOG THAT THERE ARE NO TESTS AND PASS ANY PULL REQUESTS BY EXITTING WITH 0.
