I installed PANDOC by using BREW

* brew install pandoc

I also added Readme files for assignments 6, 9, 10 and other assignments as well. Please view the folders for more.


Here are also the pandoc commands, but they're also in the sh file

pandoc -s -o README.md READMe.pdf

pandoc -s -o ./assignment6/Feedback.md assignment6_Feedback.pdf
pandoc -s -o ./assignment6/SQLReadMe.md assignment6_SQLReadme.pdf

pandoc -s -o ./assignment7/README.md assignment7.pdf

pandoc -s -o assignment8 assignment8.pdf

pandoc -s -o assignment9 assignment9.pdf

pandoc -s -o assignment10 assignment10.pdf
