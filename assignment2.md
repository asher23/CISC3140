I'd like to talk about Dependency Injection. This is an intersting topic for me since I use Asp.Net core a lot at work. Asp. Net core is new open source framework for building web apps that was developed by Microsoft. It's different from th older versions Asp.Net which has no dependency injection. I started getting into it after realizing how different the frameworks are used. Then, when I started looking at Spring, I also noticed tht it was using dependancy injection and that DI is a very important programming concept. While looking into these abstract concepts, I also learned about Inversion of Control and Containers. I found this to be really interesting since two really powerful frameworks are built on these concepts. Spring and Asp.Net Core.The following is a draft outline of how I'll be presenting. This may change.
